Project Title: Automating Amazon with Selenium WebDriver

Objective: The project aims to streamline the testing process by automating various functionalities of the Amazon website using Selenium WebDriver with Java. It encompasses a range of tasks, from navigation and login to product searches and wishlist management.

Tools Used:
Selenium WebDriver: For browser automation.
Java (Version 1.8): As the programming language.
Eclipse: Integrated Development Environment for writing and testing the code.
ChromeDriver: To interface with the Chrome browser.
Implementation Overview:

Setup:
Configured Eclipse with Selenium WebDriver and added ChromeDriver executable to the system path.
Created a new Java project and included the necessary Selenium libraries.
Automated Tasks:
•	Navigated to the Amazon homepage and maximized the browser window.
•	Implemented the Page Object Model (POM) for better maintainability of the code.
•	Automated the sign-in process, verifying successful login.
•	Developed functionality to scroll through the page to check page responsiveness.

Documentation:
Maintained clear documentation for every step of the process, including setup, execution, and the handling of different web elements.
Final Delivery:
Pushed the final version of the code to the GitHub repository, sharing the repository link for project tracking and evaluation.
